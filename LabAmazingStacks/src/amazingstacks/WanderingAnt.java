//An ant that carries food back to the nest. If it doesn't have food it wanders randomly.
//Created by James Vanderhyde, 2 November 2011
//Modified by James Vanderhyde, 29 October 2013
//  Improved ant movement toward nest.
//Modified by James Vanderhyde, 27 March 2015
//  Introduced canSeeNest method
//Modified by James Vanderhyde, 15 April 2015
//  Incorporated an old chage, the foundFoodOnLastMove functionality.
